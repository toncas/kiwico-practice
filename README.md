# KiwiCo Front-End Developer Assignment

Here is Antonio's implementation of KiwiCo's Child profile completion

## Getting Started

1. Put the project folder on to your working directory
2. Open up your Terminal and navigate to the top-level folder ```/path/to/kiwico-practice```
3. run ```npm install```
4. run ```npm start```
5. You should now be able to access ```localhost:3000``` and view the UI
6. You can optionally run ```npm run build``` to get a production ready build which will be outputted on the ```/public``` folder

### Prerequisites

npm needs to be installed into your machine


### Notes
* Total time spent: 6 hours
* Planning: 1 hour
* Coding in Javascript: 2 hours
* Styling: 3 hours

## Challenges
* Ensuring UI responsiveness for multiple screen sizes (desktop, tablet & mobile)
* Making a judgement call on how to display the UI on desktop since mobile wireframes only provided
* Conditional rendering for the different steps required to be filled out by the user

## Things I would do, given more time
* Use JQuery instead of React to reflect the company's stack.
* Minor UI changes. Font sizes, tidier media queries in my css.
* Better conditional rendering logic. Perhaps use a routing library.
* Spend more time in creating a better folder structure. Perhaps put all style sheets in one folder.
